* pick a hashing algorithm
  - ruby hash / md5 / sha1
  - benchmark? collision rate?
* algorithmic notes
*** ignoring ID
    - too many web sites fuck that up
    - libxml2 allows duplicate ids
    - algorithm would ignore changed content (I think?)
*** indexes (ascendant lookahead) needs to be implemented?
* build an rspec differ for xml
* Signature should have methods and not raw hash accessors
* MatchSet#complement needs to be O(1) not O(nmatches)
